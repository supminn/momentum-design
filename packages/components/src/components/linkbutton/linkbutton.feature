Feature: Link Button Component
  As a user of the Momentum Design System
  I want to use a component that looks like a link but functions as a button
  So that I can have link-styled interactive elements that work with click handlers instead of navigation

  Background:
    Given I have a linkbutton component available
    And the component visually resembles the mdc-link component
    And the component functionally behaves like the mdc-button component

  Scenario: Basic linkbutton functionality
    Given I have a linkbutton component
    When I render it with text content
    Then it should display the text with link-like styling
    And it should be focusable with keyboard navigation
    And it should respond to click events like a button
    And it should not navigate to a URL

  Scenario: Keyboard interaction
    Given I have a linkbutton component
    When I focus on it with Tab key
    Then it should receive focus
    When I press Enter or Space key
    Then it should trigger a click event
    And it should not cause navigation

  Scenario: Disabled state
    Given I have a linkbutton component with disabled attribute
    When I try to interact with it
    Then it should not be focusable
    And it should not respond to clicks
    And it should have appropriate disabled styling

  Scenario: Soft disabled state
    Given I have a linkbutton component with soft-disabled attribute
    When I try to interact with it
    Then it should remain focusable
    And it should allow clicks to pass through
    And it should have appropriate disabled styling
    And it should have aria-disabled="true"

  Scenario: Button-like event handling
    Given I have a linkbutton component
    When I add a click event listener
    And I click the component
    Then the click event should fire
    And it should provide button-like event details
    And it should not attempt navigation

  Scenario: Accessibility features
    Given I have a linkbutton component
    Then it should have role="button" by default
    And it should support aria-label and other ARIA attributes
    And it should be announced as a button by screen readers

  Scenario: Visual styling matches link component
    Given I have a linkbutton component
    Then it should inherit link-like visual styling
    And it should support link hover effects
    And it should support link active states
    And it should support inverted color schemes
